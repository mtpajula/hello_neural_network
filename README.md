# Hello neural network

Neural network in python for learning.

## What's currently

Some basic logic.

## To do

 * Testing (may not work)
 * Naming fixes (connection to synapse f.ex.)
 * Code cleaning
 * Different activation functions -> enum to set
 * Initializing layers with name f.ex.
 * All layers in one list, but also with references to type
 * Teacher refactor. Init with input & output 
 * Separate forward & backward propagation code?
 * Separate models from actions
 * Print & calc output errors to evaluate results
 * Test and refactor with multiple hidden layers. Currently only one hidden layer hardcoded

## Imports

    numpy
